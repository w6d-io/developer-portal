MongoDB’s first version of the database shipped in August 2009. The 1.0 release and those that followed shortly after were focused on validating a new and largely unproven approach to database design – built on a document-oriented data model and layered onto an elastic and distributed systems foundation. Those early MongoDB releases attracted masses of adoption across startups and enterprises alike.

With early usage validating product/developer fit, the MongoDB engineering team’s focus shifted to Industrializing the system beyond a niche NoSQL database into a general purpose data platform capable of serving a broad range of modern, mission-critical applications.

Major enhancements have focused on resilience and scalability, transactional guarantees, the versatility of the MongoDB query API and drivers, expanded security and privacy controls, along with cloud and mobile services.

The latest Major Release of the database is MongoDB 5.0. Developers have downloaded MongoDB more than 175 million times, and have rated it as their most wanted database.
